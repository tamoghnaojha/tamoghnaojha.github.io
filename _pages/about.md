I am currently an Assistant Professor (Grade-I) at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://srmap.edu.in/seas/computer-science-engineering/), [SRM University-AP, Andhra Pradesh, India](https://srmap.edu.in/). Previously, I was an ERCIM “Alain Bensoussan” Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with [Dr. Andrea Passarella](https://www.iit.cnr.it/en/andrea.passarella/) at the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) Research Unit at the [Institute for Informatics and Telematics (IIT)](https://www.iit.cnr.it/) of National Research Council (CNR), Italy. My current research interests are in 6G, Wireless Power Transfer, Internet of Things, Sensor-Cloud.

I completed my PhD at the [Smart Wireless Applications & Networking (SWAN) Research Group](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/swan/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,  Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2020. My PhD thesis was on "Provisioning Sensors-as-a-Service in Sensor-Cloud-based Internet of Things" under the supervision of [Prof. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/) and [Prof. Narendra Singh Raghuwanshi](http://www.manit.ac.in/content/director). I have received MS from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2014. My MS thesis was on "Architecture and Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks" under the guidance of [Prof. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/). Previously, I completed the Post Graduate Diploma in Embedded Systems from CDAC, Mohali in 2009, and B. Tech in Electronics & Communication Engg. from Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia affiliated to the West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata in 2008. Besides, I have several years of research experience working on research projects funded by different agencies such as [ITRA](http://medialabasia.in/itra/itra/) and [DeitY, Govt. of India](http://deity.gov.in/).

I am a member of IEEE and ACM. I regularly serve as a TPC/Organizing member and reviewer for several conferences and journals. In 2016, I was selected as a [Richard E Merwin Student Scholar](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/scholarships/merwin/merwin-winners/2016-merwin-winners) by IEEE Computer Society and served as a student ambassador of the IEEE Computer Society. I served as the Chairman of the Executive Committee at IEEE Student Branch, IIT Kharagpur during 2015-16. Proud to share that [IEEE TechSym 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7866269/proceeding), an IEEE international symposium chaired by me, was awarded the [2017 Darrel Chong activity award in GOLD category](https://students.ieee.org/awards/results/) by IEEE. I, with three of my friends, was the winner of GE Edison Challenge 2013 with an award of INR 10 Lakhs, and co-founded SkinCurate Research in 2014.
