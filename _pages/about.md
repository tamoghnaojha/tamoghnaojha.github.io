I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitism.ac.in/mathematics-and-computing), IIT (ISM) Dhanbad where I lead the Computing for Secure and Intelligent Networks group [(COSINE Lab)](https://people.iitism.ac.in/~cosinelab/). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus and SRM University-AP, Andhra Pradesh, India. I received MS (2014) and PhD (2021) in Computer Science from IIT Kharagpur. During 2021-2023, I was an ERCIM Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Informatics and Telematics (IIT) of the National Research Council (CNR), Italy and a research consultant at Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Italy. My current research interests are in applying AI/ML techniques for IoT and future networks. Specifically, I am working on designing intelligent solutions for Edge and Non-Terrestrial Networks, Wirelessly Powered IoT, 6G Networks, Edge-Cloud-Continuum, and Digital Twin.

Till date, I have received more than 1 Crore INR research grants sponsored by Govt. of India and private organizations. I am a Senior Member of IEEE (SM’23) and was 2016 IEEE Richard E Merwin Student scholar. In 2013, I won the GE Edison Challenge with INR 10 Lakhs. Currently, I am an Editorial Board Member of Springer Nature Scientific Reports journal and a reviewer for many IEEE Transactions and journals. I regularly serve as a TPC member and in the organizing committee of various reputed international conferences. You can find more about me on [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AFK-0738-2022) Portal and [Vidwan](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/388019) portal.
