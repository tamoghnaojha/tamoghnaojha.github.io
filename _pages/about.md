I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Computing at the [Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad](https://iitism.ac.in). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/computer-science-information-systems/), Hyderabad campus and [SRM University-AP](https://srmap.edu.in/seas/computer-science-engineering/), Andhra Pradesh, India. My current research interests are in Edge Computing and IoT. Specifically, I am working on designing intelligent solutions for Edge and Non-Terrestrial Networks, Wirelessly Powered IoT, 6G Network and Edge-Cloud-Continuum, and Digital Twin. You can find more about me on [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/AFK-0738-2022) Portal and [Vidwan](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/388019) portal.

During 2021-2023, I was an ERCIM “Alain Bensoussan” Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with [Dr. Andrea Passarella](https://www.iit.cnr.it/en/andrea.passarella/) at the [Ubiquitous Internet](https://ui.iit.cnr.it/en/) Research Unit at the [Institute for Informatics and Telematics (IIT)](https://www.iit.cnr.it/) of National Research Council (CNR), Italy, and worked on "Peer-to-Peer Wireless Power Transfer algorithms". I completed my PhD at the [Smart Wireless Applications & Networking (SWAN) Research Group](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/swan/) at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering,  Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2020. My PhD thesis was on "Provisioning Sensors-as-a-Service in Sensor-Cloud-based Internet of Things" under the supervision of [Prof. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/) and [Prof. Narendra Singh Raghuwanshi](http://www.manit.ac.in/content/director). I received MS from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2014. My MS thesis was on "Architecture and Localization in Underwater Sensor Networks" under the guidance of [Prof. Sudip Misra](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~smisra/). Previously, I completed the Post Graduate Diploma in Embedded Systems from CDAC, Mohali in 2009, and B. Tech in Electronics & Communication Engg. from Haldia Institute of Technology, Haldia affiliated to the West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata in 2008. Besides, I have several years of research experience working on research projects funded by different agencies such as [ITRA](http://medialabasia.in/itra/itra/) and [DeitY, Govt. of India](http://deity.gov.in/).

I am a Senior Member of IEEE (SM'23, M'21, S'13) and ACM (M'21, S'13). I regularly serve as a TPC member and reviewer for several conferences and journals and organize workshops in flagship conferences. In 2016, I was selected as a [Richard E Merwin Student Scholar](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/scholarships/merwin/merwin-winners/2016-merwin-winners), 1 of the 34 awardees in that year, by the IEEE Computer Society. I served as the Chairman of the Executive Committee at IEEE Student Branch, IIT Kharagpur during 2015-16. Proud to share that [IEEE TechSym 2016](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/7866269/proceeding), an IEEE international symposium chaired by me, was awarded the [2017 Darrel Chong activity award in GOLD category](https://students.ieee.org/awards/results/) by IEEE. I, with three of my colleagues, was the winner of GE Edison Challenge 2013 with an award of INR 10,00,000. In 2014, we co-founded SkinCurate Research.
